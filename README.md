# Sign Language Digit Detection

Welcome to the Sign Language Digit Detection project! This project aims to detect and recognize digits represented in Sign Language Digit Dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Details of dataset:
* Image size: 100 x 100 pixels
* Color space: RGB
* Number of classes: 10 (Digits: 0-9)
* Number of participant students: 218
* Number of samples per student: 10

## About
In this project, we leverage the power of deep learning to create a model capable of recognizing hand signs that represent digits from 0 to 9 in ASL. The trained CNN can classify these signs with high accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirement.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Sign_language_digit.ipynb` to train and evaluate the model.
4. Use the trained model to predict sign language digits from images.
